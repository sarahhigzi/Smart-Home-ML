# ABSTRACT

Smart Homes. What are they? Why are they beneficial? Moreover, why have they become more prominent? 

Smart homes have emerged as a critical solution to the challenges of modern-day living, from reducing household bills to limiting environmental impact. When used effectively, smart home devices empower consumers to have greater control over their daily energy usage, leading to significant energy savings and a more sustainable lifestyle. 

This paper aims to answer the question: "Is it possible to use machine learning techniques to build a framework designed to forecast and optimize residential energy consumption by taking historical data, weather conditions and appliance usage patterns?"  The primary objective of this study is to develop a model that can harnesses the potential of machine learning algorithms to maximize energy efficiency and management in residential homes. Utilizing tools like matplotlib and sci-kit-learn, we developed and tested several machine learning models, including regression and neural networks to target and anticipate energy use based on daily loads and hourly intervals.

The adopted method involved collecting an integrated dataset that included information on weather conditions and previous appliance consumptions provided by smart homes.  This data was then split into training and testing sets. The training set was used to teach the machine learning models how to make predictions, while the testing set was used to evaluate the models' performance. 

The findings of this study hold significant promise. They demonstrate that machine learning technologies and algorithms can enhance and provide more accurate predictions. However, it's important to note that the accuracy of these predictions may vary depending on the quality and quantity of the data available. Thus, enabling precise forecasting in future investigations of power consumption in household units. This could revolutionize how we manage energy resources, leading to substantial cost savings and a more sustainable future.
