# Smart-Home-ML
Using machine learning to predict the total energy consumption in smart homes based on historical data, weather conditions and appliance usage patterns 

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project utilizes a smart home dataset with integrated weather data, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information).

ðŸ”— **Dataset File**: [`Smart_Home_Dataset.csv.zip`](https://github.com/sarahhigzi/Smart-Home-ML/blob/Smart_Home_Dataset.csv.zip/HomeC.csv.zip)

> âœ… Located in the `Smart_Home_Dataset.csv.zip` branch
