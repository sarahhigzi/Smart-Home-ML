The literature review covers studies that have incorporated historical data, climate variables, and fluctuations in appliance usage in models. It also explores the qualities of various machine learning models in improving energy predictability, such as decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods.

## 2.2 Background on Energy Consumption in Smart Homes

### 2.2.1 Historical Context
Historically, energy consumption in residential buildings has become a significant concern, reflecting broader problems related to environmental impact and resource depletion. The evaluation of historical data on energy use in buildings, particularly the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, reveals a surge in consumption rates because of the rising demand for indoor comfort levels and the increasing amount of time spent indoors. This trend has been observed since the 20th century, with energy consumption in residential buildings steadily increasing over the years (Pérez-Lombard et al., 2008).

Buildings play a significant role in exacerbating climate change, accounting for one-third of global energy consumption and one-quarter of CO2 emissions (González-Torres et al., 2022). Since the fifties, the global contribution from buildings towards energy usage has notably accelerated, accounting for between 20% and 40% in developed countries. This upward trend in consumption rates is likely to continue, pushed by population growth, comfort demands, and overall changes in building use and occupancy patterns. (Pérez-Lombard et al., 2008).

While the growing worldwide energy consumption and mounting CO2 emissions clearly require a response (Jackson et al., 2018). The advantages of globalization, rising affluence, and population growth have all contributed to this trend. Despite the pressing need to address climate change, global energy usage and the corresponding carbon dioxide emissions; the constant quest for more extensive and visually appealing buildings has resulted in a notable rise in energy usage.

Unlike the conventional residential buildings, smart homes provide a good way for energy conservation using the advanced technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In the environment of smart homes, IoT is the term that describes the interconnected gadgets and systems that communicate locally and over the internet to manage the various household tasks automatically or remotely. These gadgets can either process, record, transmit, or do something with the data they get from their surroundings using the embedded sensors, software, or other techniques.

Smart homes employ data-based methods and automated systems to enhance energy use, which usually results in a significant decrease in energy consumption. Harris et al. (2019) have discovered that energy consumption can be cut by 25% through the adoption of smart home features such as the automation of HVAC systems, switching off the lights, and other high-energy appliances. These systems can alter the energy consumption depending on real-time data like occupancy pattern and the weather conditions outside the building, thus improving energy efficiency (Smith, 2020). Besides, the installation of the smart meters and the energy management systems in the homes, it has also been proven to be helpful for homeowners to receive the opportunity to change their energy habits, actively saving money (Brown & Green, 2021). Therefore, the smart home market has been expanding quickly, and according to the research of Johnson et al. (2022), 63% of American homes will be classified as 'smart' by 2025, which leads to combat energy efficiency and sustainability concerns.
