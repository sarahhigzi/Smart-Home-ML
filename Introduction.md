# Chapter 1: Introduction

The central goal of this paper is to highlight the energy waste prevalent in modern households. Irrespective of the widespread use of smart appliances and devices, many households do not have a formalised plan of action to control energy consumption, which translates into abnormally high energy bills, a more significant environmental footprint and possibly excess wear and tear of the household equipment.

This project's objective is to optimize energy usage by refining models based on data from smart home devices through machine learning and data analysis. The project also aligns with the evolution of smart homes and technology conservation by using data science to improve energy efficiency, addressing a problem that all contemporary homes attempt to solve.

## 1.1 Research Context and Significance

Smart homes are those that have several sophisticated automated systems installed, enabling technology-based central control over the entire house. These homes include a network of linked appliances, often managed by a centralized location like a control system or an app on a smartphone. These devices may be connected via the Internet of Things (IoT) and can be managed, controlled, or viewed remotely.

## 1.2 Importance of the Study

Smart homes can deal with problems that people face daily, for instance:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Smart homes make heating, cooling, and electrical systems more adaptable. Cutting unnecessary energy waste leads to lower utility bills and reduced environmental impact.
- **Enhanced Comfort and Convenience**: Automating tedious tasks and enabling remote control of the home environment enhances quality of life and accessibility.
- **Improved Security**: Smart homes enable real-time monitoring and alerts, improving home security.
- **Adaptability to Modern Lifestyles**: Technological integration meets the needs of modern living, particularly for those working from home.

## 1.3 Aim

The project aims to develop a data-driven machine learning model for optimizing energy consumption in smart homes, thereby promoting energy efficiency, cost savings, and environmental sustainability.

### Research Questions:
- **Influence of Weather**: What is the effect of weather conditions (heat, humidity, visibility, etc.) on overall energy consumption?
- **Usage Trends for Appliances**: Which appliances consume the most energy, and how can they be used more efficiently?
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Are there identifiable daily or seasonal trends in energy usage?
